### Description
Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`.
```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
```
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

### Note:

`s` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`.
`p` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`, and characters like `.` or `*`.

### Example
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```
```
Input:
s = "ab"
p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```
```
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
```
```
Input:
s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false

### Ideas
DP: use dp(i,j) to represent the status of equivalence of ith text and jth pattern
