### Description

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. 

You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

### Example 

``````cpp
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
``````

### Ideas
- Brute force: use two pointers inside for loop, and record the length of the palindromic string.
- DP: ...
